        <h1>Are animals Real?</h1>
        <h3>By: Khayla McCray</h3>
        <p>We live in a world where everything is a lie. Including the truth about animals. Not one animal is different. Especially when they are all decendants of Zebras. Doctor Fakename Realperson at Harvard university has been testing their blood ever since the age of 2. So if anyone would know, he would. We got an interview with him where he said "Believe what you will about animals, but Dragon Tales is better then Curios George. That is all". The interview felt like a fever dream but you can see clearly that he is proving our point.</p>
